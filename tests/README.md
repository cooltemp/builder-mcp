## Test Coverage

### üîß Models API (`models.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing for all Builder.io model operations:

   - Fetches a specific model by ID
   - Tests error handling for non-existent models

4. **Create New Model** - `POST /models`
   - Creates a test model with basic fields
   - Validates successful creation and response data

5. **Verify Model Exists**
   - Confirms the created model appears in models list
   - Verifies model can be fetched by ID

6. **Update Model** - `PUT /models/:id`

8. **Delete Model** - `DELETE /models/:id`
   - Deletes the test model
   - Validates successful deletion

9. **Verify Deletion**

   - Verifies error when trying to fetch deleted model

10. **Error Handling**
    - Tests invalid model creation
    - Tests updates to non-existent models
    - Tests deletion of non-existent models

### üìÑ Content API (`content.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing for all Builder.io content operations:

1. **Get Content from Model** - `GET /content/:model`
   - Fetches content from existing models
   - Tests query parameters (limit, includeRefs, cacheSeconds)
   - Handles non-existent models gracefully

2. **Get Content by ID** - `GET /content/:model/:id`
   - Fetches specific content entries by ID
   - Tests error handling for non-existent content

3. **Create Content** - `POST /content/:model`
   - Creates new content entries with test data
   - Validates response structure and draft status

4. **Update Content** - `PUT /content/:model/:id`
   - Updates existing content entries
   - Validates updated data and metadata

5. **Publish Content** - `POST /content/:model/:id/publish`
   - Publishes draft content entries
   - Validates published status change

6. **Unpublish Content** - `POST /content/:model/:id/unpublish`
   - Unpublishes content back to draft
   - Validates status change back to draft

7. **Search Content**
   - Tests text-based content search
   - Handles empty search results gracefully

8. **Error Handling**
   - Tests invalid content creation
   - Tests updates to non-existent content
   - Tests publish operations on non-existent content

### üìÅ Upload API (`upload.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing for all Builder.io upload operations:

1. **Upload from URL** - `POST /upload/url`
   - Uploads image from https://placehold.co/600x400
   - Tests with folder and metadata options
   - Handles invalid and non-existent URLs

2. **File Upload** - `POST /upload`
   - Uploads file buffers (1x1 PNG test image)
   - Tests with folder and metadata options
   - Handles empty buffers gracefully

3. **Get File Info** - `GET /upload/:id`
   - Retrieves file information and metadata
   - Tests error handling for non-existent files

4. **Delete File** - `DELETE /upload/:id`
   - Deletes uploaded test files
   - Tests error handling for non-existent files

5. **Error Handling**
   - Tests network error scenarios
   - Validates file type restrictions (route-level)

### üî§ TypeScript Generation (`types.test.ts`)

Comprehensive testing for TypeScript interface generation:

1. **Generate All Interfaces** - `GET /generate-types`
   - Generates interfaces for all available models
   - Creates and validates index file
   - Tests file creation and content structure

2. **Generate Specific Interface** - `GET /generate-types/:model`
   - Generates interface for individual models
   - Tests various field type mappings
   - Validates TypeScript syntax

3. **File Operations**
   - Tests directory cleaning functionality
   - Handles missing directories gracefully
   - Validates file write operations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handles models with no fields
   - Handles invalid field types gracefully
   - Handles malformed model data

5. **TypeScript Validation**
   - Validates syntactically correct TypeScript
   - Tests consistent naming conventions
   - Verifies proper interface structure

### üßπ Cleanup

The test suite automatically cleans up any test models created during testing, even if tests fail.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Tests require valid Builder.io API credentials
- Tests will be skipped if credentials are not found
- A temporary test model named `test-model-vitest` is created and deleted
- Tests use real API calls to Builder.io (not mocked)
- Each test run is independent and cleans up after itself

### üîß Configuration

Test configuration is in `vitest.config.ts`:
- 30-second timeout for API calls
- Node.js environment
- Path aliases matching the main application
- Global test utilities available

### üìä Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Found X models
‚úÖ Found X model IDs  
‚úÖ Successfully fetched model: model-name
‚úÖ Successfully created test model with ID: abc123
‚úÖ Verified test model exists in models list
‚úÖ Successfully added description field to test model
‚úÖ Verified description field is present in updated model
‚úÖ Successfully deleted test model: abc123
‚úÖ Verified test model no longer exists in models list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing API Keys
If you see warnings about missing API keys, add them to your `.env` file:
```env
BUILDER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key
```

### API Errors
If tests fail with API errors:
1. Verify your API keys are correct
2. Check your Builder.io account permissions
3. Ensure you have access to the Admin API

### Network Issues
If tests timeout:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Builder.io API is accessible
3. Consider increasing timeout in `vitest.config.ts`
